# Introduction

If you'd like to help translate Milkman to another language, simply fork this repository and issue a pull request when you are done. View the existing localizations for an example of how to format your translations.

# Utilities

Please use the ResX Resource Manager tool when managing your localization efforts. This is an OpenSource tool that makes it easy to see which strings need to be translated when new ones are added.
